# In this assignment we are interested if 
# Males go more frequently to doctors than females. In order to answer this question we do an analysis on
#   a cross-section data originating from the 1977â€“1978 Australian Health Survey.

# 0) Clear work space
rm(list=ls())

# 1) Load tidyverse and modelsummary packages and install and load the "AER" package
install.packages("AER")
library(tidyverse); library(modelsummary); library(AER)

# Load the data of doctor visits from AER package (more info: https://rdrr.io/cran/AER/man/DoctorVisits.html)
data("DoctorVisits")

df <- DoctorVisits
rm( DoctorVisits )

# 2) Make a quick data summary on all the variables
summary(df)

# 3) Make descriptive statistics on the variable visits conditional on the gender
datasummary(gender*visits ~ sum + mean + sd, data = df)

# 4) Create a ggplot where you display the conditional distributions of visits given the gender
ggplot(df) +
  geom_density(aes(visits, fill = gender), alpha=0.4) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of visits across gender",
       x = "Number of visits",
       y = "Frequency",
       fill = "Gender") +
  theme_classic()

# 5-6) Would you consider this a useful graph? Use instead a stacked bar graph!
#   a) create a new tibble, which groups by gender and visits and count the cases (summarise)
#   b) create a ggplot using aux with the geometry: geom_bar. 
#       You should specify the following arguments: stat = "identity", position = "fill"

new_df <- df %>% group_by(gender, visits) %>% summarize(n_cases = n())

ggplot(new_df) +
  geom_bar(aes(visits, n_cases, fill = gender), stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of visits across gender",
       x = "Number of visits",
       y = "Proportion",
       fill = "Gender") +
  theme_classic()

# 7) Test whether the number of visits are the same for male and female
#   Hint: check the t.test function and use `~` sign to define the two groups.
#   You should have a Welch-Two Sample t-test and its results.

t.test(visits ~ gender, data=df[df$gender %in% c("male","female"),])

#since the p-value is really low, we can reject the null hypothesis, and there is a difference
